The Sometimes is a font based on the Times New Roman font made by Monotype.  I created the Sometimes typeface by cutting some serifs off form the TNR.  And thats the reason why I choosed the name Sometimes. The new typeface has classical and modern look at the same time. To show how Sometimes font works in use I designed a fictional album cover for the Apocalyptica music band. Also I designed two merch products for the band, a totebag and a cello bridge. I choosed Apocalyptica because they play metal music with cellos, so they mix modern style with classical just like the Sometimes.
